# L3: Lizzie's Land Lord

This is a variant of "The Landlord's Game" patented in 1904 and
published in 1906 by Elizabeth Magie which is now in the public domain.

The trademark to "The Landlord's Game®"; in the United States is owned
by Thomas Forsyth, owner/manager of yourPlay™, LLC, who produces and
distributes a board game under this name. See [his
website](https://landlordsgame.info/) for more information. This
implementation and its author are in no way sponsored by, endorsed by,
or affiliated with Thomas Forsyth, and/or yourPlay, LLC. All references
to "The Landlord's Game" in the documentation or source code of this
implementation (except in this paragraph) refer to Elizabeth Magie's
public domain version.

This implementation is designed as an exercise for my Python courses; I'm
currently not putting any effort into polishing the game or creating an
enjoyable (or even realistically playable) gaming experience.
