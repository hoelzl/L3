### TO BEGINNERS

Read the rules carefully without trying to thoroughly understand them at
first. Then, in order to save the time and avoid the confusion incident
to the purchase of cards at the outset (See Rule I) let each player take
one of the "average hands" indicated below, and $75 in cash. The
purchasing of cards is quickly and easily done by those familiar with
the game, but is apt to be a trifle confusing for beginners.

The game is not complicated, although at first it may appear so. On the
contrary, it is very simple, which the players will readily see after
having made a few moves. The principal thing each player has to do is to
look after the collection of his rents, railroad fares and wages.

#### THE LANDLORD'S GAME.

The Landlord's Game may be played by two or more.

Each player selects one checker, and, if there are two players, each
provides himself with $6oo; if three players, each $500; if four
players, each $400.

All money and implements not in use by the players should be put upon
the large space in the middle of the board, marked MISCELLANEOUS.

Determine first player by throwing dice.

NOTE: The Education and Professor cards are used only when the game is
being played under the Single Tax Rules.

##### THE OBJECT OF THE LANDLORD'S GAME.

The object of the game is to get as much wealth as possible, and the player who
has the most in cash, cards and houses at the end of the game is the winner or
millionaire. Every card and every house counts the holder or owner 100 at the
end of the game.

##### RULES.

**RULE 1.   Buying Titles to Lots. ---** Shuffle the green cards and deal out one
around, to the left, until 24 have been dealt, then place the remainder of the
pack on the board. These green cards represent Title Deeds to Lots, Charters for
Franchises, and (one) Broker's License. The original sale price of each card is
marked on the card itself as well as on the corresponding board space after the
words "For Sale." Each player has the privilege or option of buying any or all
of the cards which have been dealt to him, the sale price of the cards being
paid into the PUBLIC TREASURY.  Cards not purchased must be returned to the
pack.  The players own the spaces on the board corresponding to the cards they
hold.  As one generally needs between $50 and $75 to pay expenses around the
board, or until he has earned his wages, it is always advisable for him to take
this into consideration when purchasing cards.

After the game has begun the sale prices of all cards then in use by the players
are regulated by the demand, but no card can be bought from the pack for less
than the original sale price, although these cards may be bid up as high as the
players please.

**RULE 2.How to Move Checkers. ---** The players place their checkers upon MOTHER
EARTH, the beginning point. Then the first player throws his dice, and,
ac­cording to the number thrown, moves along the first side of the board and
follows the rule applying to the space upon which he has stopped.

Throwing Doubles --- See Rule 17.

When the first player has finished his play, the next player throws his dice,
and moves; then the third player, and so on.

If a player is on any of the spaces between the Chances he may move in either
direction. Bear this well in mind as it is sometimes more desirable to make a
back­ward move than a forward one.

NOTE: The number of the rule applying to each space is printed in the corner or
inside edge of that space.

The numbers on the outside of the spaces are placed there for the convenience of
the player in moving. For instance, if he throws a 6 he moves to the 6th space,
THE PIKE.  If his next throw is an 8 he adds 6 and 8, which are 14, and moves to
the 14th space, which is BEGGARMAN’S COURT, and so on adding or subtracting
according to whether his move be forward or backward.

**RULE 3.  Wages. ---** When a player reaches or passes the beginning point, MOTHER
EARTH, he is supposed to have performed a certain amount of labor worth $100.
This amount, his "wages," is paid to him from MISCELLANEOUS pile.

In all money transactions between any individual player and the board, the next
player to the left may act as representative for the board, paying wages, making
change, etc., before such next player makes his own throw.

**RULE 4.  Taxes. ---** the blue spaces; FOOD, FUEL, SHELTER and CLOTHING, represent
the Absolute Necessities of life and when a player stops upon one of these
spaces he pays $10 taxes into the PUBLIC TREASURY.

RULE 5.  D. F. Hogg's Game Preserves and Lord Blueblood's Estate represent
property held out of use, and when a player's move brings him upon one of these
spaces he is "trespassing" and must go to JAIL -- that is, put his checker on
the JAIL space.

**RULE 6.  Jail. ---** A player in JAIL must remain there until his next turn.  Then
he may come out upon paying into the PUBLIC TREASURY a fine of $50, or if he
throws a double (which is called "serving his time") he may come out without
paying the fine.  If he does not pay the fine or throw a double he must wait
until his next turn.  He cannot, however, miss more than three turns if he has
sufficient property on which to realize the amount of his fine.  When he does
come out of JAIL he must begin to count his move on the space immediately in
front of the JAIL (Shelter).

**RULE 7.  Land Rent. ---** When a player stops upon a lot owned by another player,
he must pay the land rent to the owner. If he stops upon one of his own lots he
pays nothing.  If the lot is not yet owned by any of the players, it is "For
Sale," and the player stopping upon it may purchase it at the original sale
price, provided no other player bids more for it. If the player who has stopped
upon it is willing to pay the highest price bid, he has the first option. If he
cannot or does not want to pay the highest price bid, then the player bidding
the highest price must take the lot at the price he has bid for it. If the first
player does not buy the lot and some other player does, the first player pays
the land rent to the purchaser. If no player buys it the land rent is paid into
the PUBLIC TREASURY. If the lot is bought the purchaser takes the corresponding
Title Deed card from the pack.

**RULE 8.  Speculation. ---** This space represents all speculation other than land
speculation.  If a player's throw would bring him to this space he may refuse to
move -- remaining where he is -- and the next player proceeds.  If he elects to
play, the ownership of Speculation card for Broker's License is determined as
are Title Deeds under Rule 7.  Ownership of card being settled, the player pays
$10 "ante" to the Broker (holder of Speculation card), or, if the card is
purchased by no one at this time, he pays the “ante” into the MISCELLANEOUS
pile; then he throws his dice again, and if he throws a double, he wins $100; an
11, $90; a 10, $80; 9, $70; 8, $60; 7, $50; 6, $40; 5, $30; and pays 10 percent
of his winnings to holder of the Speculation card, or to MISCELLANEOUS pile if
no one has purchased the card.  If a 3 or 4 is thrown the Broker is supposed to
be caught in a "skin game," -- the speculator wins nothing, and the Broker or
holder of Speculation card (if it is held by any of the players) goes to JAIL
and the card is returned to the pack.

Winnings are taken from MISCELLANEOUS pile.

**RULE 9.  Franchises. ---** The yellow spaces -- SOAKUM LIGHTING SYSTEM and
SLAMBANG TROLLEY, and pink spaces:-

RAILROADS, represent public utilities owned by private parties.  When a player
stops upon one of these franchise spaces he must pay $5 to the owner. If the
franchise is not yet owned by any of the players it for sale and the player
stopping upon it may purchase it at the original sale price, $50, provided no
other player bids more for it.  If the player stopping upon it is willing to pay
the highest price bid, he has the first option.  If he cannot or does not want
to pay the highest price bid, then the player bidding the highest price must
take the franchise at the price he has bid.  If the first player does not buy
the franchise and some other player does, the first player pays to the purchaser
the amount the space calls for. If no player buys it, the amount is paid into
the PUBLIC TREASURY.  If the space is bought the purchaser takes the
corresponding card from the pack and keeps it.

MUNICIPAL CINCH --- If a player owns both SOAKUM LIGHTING SYSTEM and SLAMBANG
TROLLEY he has a "municipal cinch," raises the rates, and collects $25 instead
of $5 from every other player stopping upon one of these spaces.

MONOPOLY --- If one player owns 2 railroads, he charges $10 fare; if 3, he
charges $20; 4, $50.

TRUST --- If two players own all of the RAILROADS between them, they may at any
time pool their railroad interests and form a Trust, charging the other players
$40 for each RAILROAD space and dividing profits.

**RULE 10.**  Central Park is supposed to be maintained by public funds, and
therefore a player may stop in it without paying anything.

**RULE 11.  Chances. ---** If a player stops upon one of the CHANCE spaces he draws
a card from the red pack and follows directions on same.  In each case the card
drawn is returned to the pack.

**RULE 12.  Poor House. ---** If at any time a player has not enough money to pay
his expenses, and cannot borrow any (see Rule 16) or cannot sell or mortgage any
of his property, he must go to the POOR HOUSE, where he remains until his next
turn.  Then he throws again and moves out if he can afford to make the move.

## RULES.

### FOR ADVANCED AND SCIENTIFIC PLAYERS.

When players have become thoroughly familiar with the rules and principles of
the game they will readily perceive that if the game be continued long enough
the inevitable result will be that one player will own everything on the board. 
Under the ordinary rules, however, two or three sittings would probably be
necessary to reach this end; therefore it is suggested that in order to arrive
more quickly at a decisive point, the following rules be observed:

When ten houses have been erected -- whether by one or more players -- taxes
(blue spaces) are doubled (20): when twenty-five houses have been erected taxes
are again doubled ($40), which is the limit.

Players will note that the railroads divide each side of the board into two
sections, making eight sections on the entire board.  When all the lots in any
one section have been improved with at least one house each the land rent on
every lot in that section is doubled.  When the lots in any one section have
been improved with two houses each the land rent is again doubled; and three
houses doubles it again.

For purposes of the game the number of houses that may be erected on each lot is
limited to three. The house rent remains as before -- $10 for each house in
addition to land rent.

#### TAX TABLE



| When number of Houses on board is | Taxes are:  |
| ---------------------------------:| -----------:|
|                                10 |        $20. |
|                        25 or more |         40. |

#### THE MONARCH OF THE WORLD.

The Landlord's Game is based on present prevailing business methods.  This the
players can prove for themselves; and they can also prove what must be the
logical outcome of such a system, i.e., that the land monopolist has absolute
control of the situation.  If a person wishes to prove this assertion -- having
first proven that the principles of the game are based on realities -- let him
do so by giving to one player all of the land and giving to the other players
all other advantages of the game.  Provide each player with $100 at the start
and let the game proceed under the rules with the exception that the landlord
gets no wages.  By this simple method one can satisfy himself of the truth of
the assertion that the land monopolist is monarch of the world.  The remedy is
the Single Tax.

__________

## THE SINGLE TAX.

If the players wish to prove how the application of the Single Tax would benefit
everybody by equalizing and opportunities and raising wages, they may at any
time during the game put the single tax into operation by a vote of at least two
of the players.

### RULES.

Players are left in possession of their holdings and, with the exception that
the Title Deeds are of no value, the gain goes on as before under the following
rules :

**RULE 1.**  Pay no taxes on Absolute Necessities.

**RULE 2.**  All land rent is paid into the public treasury to be used for public
improvements.  (Begin game under single tax with empty PUBLIC TREASURY.)

**RULE 3.**  All railroad fares and franchise rates are paid to the individual
owners as before until the public takes control of them (see Rule 6), when they
are FREE.

**RULE 4.**  When a player stops upon an unimproved lot (except Government
Reservations, see following rule) he first pays the full land rent into the
PUBLIC TREASURY, and then, if he so desires and can afford it, he may improve
the lot by the erection of a house thereon. But if the space upon which he has
stopped is already improved by another player's house, he first pays the full
land rent into the PUBLIC TREASURY and then pays the full house rent to the
owner of the house.  If at anytime a player has money to invest, he may, in his
turn, erect a house on any unimproved lot he chooses, whether his checker is on
that space or not, provided no other player bids against him for the privilege
of building there.

The "bid" money (or rent) is paid into the PUBLIC TREASURY.

**RULE 5.**  HOGG"S GAME PRESERVES and LORD BLUEBLOOD'S ESTATE are supposed to be
reserved by the Government for Free College sites (see part c, Rule 6), and
until the colleges are erected a player whose throw brings him upon one of these
spaces is trespassing and must go to JAIL.

**RULE 6.**
<div>
<style type="text/css">
  ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha; }
</style>

1. When the cash in the PUBLIC TREASURY from land rents and fines
   amounts to $50 it is paid to the holder of the SOAKUM LIGHTING SYSTEM charter
   for the purchase of the plant, which is then owned and operated by the
   public, (the change to public ownership being by condemnation, excluding
   value of right of way).  The card is returned to the pack, and henceforth the
   Lighting System space is free to all players.  If the card is still in the
   pack the $50 is paid into the MISCELLANEOUS pile.

2. When the cash in the PUBLIC TREASURY amounts to $50 more, go through the
   same process with SLAMBANG TROLLEY; then P.D.Q.R.R.; then GEE WIZZ R. R , and
   so on around the board until all the railroads are free.

3. Then when the cash in the PUBLIC TREASURY amounts to $50 more it is put into
   the MISCELLANEOUS pile from which a Free College is taken and placed on LORD
   BLUEBLOOD'S ESTATE and the jail penalty is annulled. In the same manner the
   next $50 puts up a FREE COLLEGE on HOGG’S GAME PRESERVES, and the jail
   penalty is annulled.

4. When the cash in the PUBLIC TREASURY amounts to $50 more it is transferred to
   the MISCELLANEOUS pile and WAGES ARE RAISED TO $110.  When the cash amounts
   to $50 more, wages are raised to $120, and so on, raising wages $10 for every
   $50 in the TREASURY, until the end of the game.
</div>

**RULE 7.**  After the first FREE COLLEGE is erected, if a player goes to college he
takes a blue card marked Education and when he gets four of these cards he
exchanges them for a card marked Professor, which card counts him 100 at the end
of the game.

**RULE 8.**  Under the Single Tax the Poor House is eliminated because all players
have access to land -- the natural opportunities to labor.If a player cannot
afford to make the move called for by his throw, he puts his checker upon any
NATURAL OPPORTUNITY space (inner corners) he may choose, back of the space to
which is throw would bring him.  Then just before throwing in his next turn he
takes from the MISCELLANEOUS pile the wages called for by the NATURAL
OPPORTUNITY space upon which he has placed his checker, pays his rent for such
space into the PUBLIC TREASURY, throws his dice, and moves out.  A player must
make the move, if possible, even if it takes him to JAIL.
